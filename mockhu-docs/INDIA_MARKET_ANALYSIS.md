## 🚨 Risks & Challenges (Be Realistic)

### **Risk 1: User Acquisition Cost**
```
Problem: Expensive to get users initially

- Organic growth (student-to-student)
- College partnerships
- Referral rewards

Estimated CAC: ₹50-100/user (low for B2C)
```

### **Risk 2: Verification Complexity**
```
Problem: Verifying 40M students is hard
Solution:
- .edu email (easy for top colleges)

- Phone number verification (common)
- Start with top 100 colleges first

Not perfect, but good enough
```

### **Risk 3: Content Moderation**
```
Problem: Indian students = diverse, can be controversial
Solution:
- AI content filtering
- Community moderators
- Clear guidelines

History: Snapchat survived despite Facebook copying
```

### **Risk 5: Monetization Backlash**
```
Problem: Students hate paying
Solution:
- Keep FREE version generous
- Premium is optional (badges, analytics)

Example: Instagram (free) vs LinkedIn Premium
```

### **Risk 6: Market Timing**
```
Problem: Is it the right time?
Answer: YES, post-COVID is PERFECT
- Students want online connections
- Remote learning normalized

## 💪 Can You Survive? (Personal Assessment)

### **Financial Survival**

#### **Bootstrap Option** (No Funding)
```
Year 1 Costs:
- Server: ₹50,000/year
- Domain: ₹10,000/year
- Marketing: ₹2,00,000
- Misc: ₹50,000

Total: ₹3,10,000 (~$4,000)

Can you afford? If yes → Bootstrap
Can't afford? → Raise angel round
```

#### **Angel Funding Option** (₹20-50 lakh)
```
Use For:
- Team hiring (1-2 developers)
- Marketing (₹10 lakh)
- Servers (₹5 lakh)
- 12-month runway

This is EASILY raisable for this idea

- Join accelerator (Y Combinator for India: GSF, Surge)
```

### **Competitive Survival**

```
Barriers to Entry (Your Moats):

ONE college, ONE city, ONE problem.

Facebook started at Harvard.
LinkedIn started in Silicon Valley.
